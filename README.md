## Introduction

Labeling proteins in biological images is a critical task in bioinformatics and biomedical research. It requires analyzing microscopic images and identifying specific protein patterns or structures. This project utilizes transfer learning, which involves using pre-trained models trained on large-scale datasets, and regularization techniques to improve protein labeling accuracy.

Transfer learning allows us to leverage the knowledge and feature extraction capabilities of pre-trained models, such as ResNet, Inception, or VGG, which have been trained on large image datasets like ImageNet. By fine-tuning these models on protein labeling tasks, we can adapt them to recognize protein patterns effectively.

Regularization techniques, such as dropout, batch normalization, and weight decay, are used to prevent overfitting and improve generalization performance. These techniques help to control model complexity, reduce over-reliance on specific features, and improve the robustness of protein labeling predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation is not included in this repository due to privacy and licensing restrictions. However, the code provided assumes the availability of a labeled protein dataset suitable for training deep learning models. Ensure that the dataset is appropriately organized, and the labels are associated with the corresponding protein images.

## Model Architecture

The model architecture for protein labeling utilizes a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) as the backbone. The backbone network, such as ResNet, is loaded with pre-trained weights, enabling it to capture high-level features from the protein images effectively.

On top of the backbone, additional layers are added to adapt the model to the specific protein labeling task. These layers include fully connected layers, activation functions, and a final output layer with the appropriate number of classes.

The transfer learning process involves freezing the pre-trained layers of the backbone and only training the newly added layers. This allows the model to learn protein-specific features while retaining the knowledge captured by the pre-trained model.

## Installation

To use this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/aatmprakash/Human-Protine-labling-Transfer-Learning-Regularization.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies using `pip`:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Prepare your dataset according to the required directory structure and adjust the code as needed to load and preprocess the data.

## Usage

Before running the code, make sure you have installed the required dependencies and prepared your dataset accordingly.

To train the protein labeling model, run the following command:

```
python train.py
```

The model will begin training using the specified dataset, hyperparameters, transfer learning, and regularization techniques. The trained model checkpoints will be saved for future use.

To evaluate the trained model on the test dataset, run the following command:

```
python evaluate.py --model saved_models/model.pth
```

Replace `model.pth` with the appropriate saved model checkpoint file.

## Results

The evaluation script will provide performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's protein labeling performance on the test dataset. These metrics quantify the model's ability to correctly classify proteins into different classes.

The results obtained from the evaluation

 can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the transfer learning and regularization techniques for protein labeling tasks. It can also serve as a benchmark for comparison with other models or approaches.
